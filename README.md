## Overview

This is a **RESTful API backend** for an Expense Tracker application built with **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Netlify Functions**. It provides secure user authentication, expense tracking, financial goal management, and analytics to help users monitor their spending and savings effectively.

- Password hashing using `bcryptjs` for secure storage.
- Middleware protects endpoints by validating JWT tokens.

### User Profile & Financial Goals

- Snapshots of salary and saving goals saved with each expense for accurate history.

### Expense Management
- Add expenses with categories, notes, and timestamps.
- Default categories included (Food, Shopping, Vehicles, etc.).
- Users can add custom expense categories.

### Balance and Saving Calculation
- Automatically calculates current balance and monthly savings.
- Updates dynamically as expenses or goals change.
- Tracks total accumulated savings over time.

### Spending Analytics API
- Filtered summaries of expenses by category.
- Supports multiple time filters: current month, last 6 months, current year, and all-time.
